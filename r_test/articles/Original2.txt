administration gang truce first years funes administration thus showed shift efforts develop integrated policy gangs series measures focused cracking measures resisted gangs even led efforts gangs openly pressure government context sense security deteriorated homicide rates seen policy makers key indicator success remained extremely high end first months influential actors like mass media private business sector well us government pressed strongly results media stepped pressure constant reporting homicide numbers violent incidents questioning funes administration security policies november national newspaper el diario de hoy opened strong statement directed government security worse administration based results recent opinion survey stated crime risen funes administration cited public belief security plans work contrary gangs getting stronger message clear public large becoming anxious result pressures poor results area security minister security manuel melgar decided resign

securitisation surprise many march came light government facilitated truce two principal gangs result truce homicide rate fell spectacularly days truce still place end zo z total number homicides zo decreased almost per cent first disavowing truce soon became clear government endorsed process newly appointed minister justice public security munguia payes played key role strategy initiated approved controlled office however acutely aware government might accused negotiating violent criminals facilitation publicly implemented two close associates outside government raul mijango monsignor fabio colindres choice word facilitation emphasised government wanted portray clear distance gangs decision engage bishop process shows munguia payes raul mijango aware need convince least neutralise important audiences bluntly expressed businessman el salvador business community country people put priest front church part brain disconnects stop asking questions reach truce gangs talks initiated long standing gang leaders imprisoned isolated high security jail zacatecoluca leaders first agreed need reduction violence idea cessation hostilities gangs jointly formulating list general requests salvadorean authorities thirty leaders transferred back common low security prisons great majority imprisoned gang members served sentences communicate agreement impose rank file thus funes administration want get openly immersed truce clear gangs made promises towards also made promises demands vis vis government turn government made gestures towards gang leaders among others relaxing prison regimes leaders emphasised however position salvadorean government towards truce highly ambiguous minister justice public security secretly developed plan never intended make public main reason new minister munguia payes public always objected type negotiation dialogue gangs turned course action desire decrease staggering homicide rates decision start talking gangs truly emergency measure interesting note munguia payes involvement discovered journalists online newspaper el faro first explicitly denied government officials including minister press conference minister munguia payes offered extremely weak unconvincing explanation removal gang leaders de securitising securitising gang policies high security prisons however chose admit responsibility declared architect whole plan fact government involvement talks initially kept secret shows key problem strategy types dialogue seem unavoidable strategy extremely unpopular among many relevant audiences therefore difficult communicate publicly although president funes informed strategy given support minister kept distance truce led ambiguous government position one hand minister justice public security acknowledged role main architect truce hand president funes emphasised government willing negotiate criminals fair say announcement truce type two pronged strategy followed firstly process securitisation got even stronger gangs portrayed far important threat security conceded therefore authorities implemented even extraordi nary measures creation specialised police forces deal gangs anti gang directorate pnc secondly government introduced different kind extraordinary measure secretly sponsoring facilitating process dialogue negotiations gangs principal objective diminish extremely high homicide rate two approaches closely linked continuation hard hand strategy permitted excused facilitation truce shielding admini stration accusation soft crime giving gangs although government emphasised negotiated gangs truce clearly created something win win situation government old gang leaders facing public anguish growing sense insecurity funes administration principal aim reach reduction homicide levels however achieved bringing back power old gang leaders years isolation high security prisons lost control gangs younger generations sending veteran leaders back common prisons government lifted separation isolation also handed back effective control homeboys prison streets administration also gave veteran leaders broad access media explain vision active support truce gangs published various communiques positions petitions newly empowered leaders seized opportunity communicating imposing tregua gang members complying would cosdy truce breakers would killed comrades fair say however lowering homicide rates means gang truce came high price strengthened position older leaders also contributed situation growing unity organisational strength among gangs meanwhile truce address question extortion apparently main source income gangs implicitly gang leaders recognised important political actors ongoing drama security policy el salvador conclusion paper analysed salvadorean government clearly unsuccessful efforts de securitise gangs shown first year funes government emphasised need integrated policies deal issue alternative approaches either called attention underlying causes gang problem prevention rehabilitation policies called pragmatic approach dialogue even negotiation gangs however even idea talking gangs proved extremely unpopular funes government soon decided go approach returned hard handed policy measures similar propagated previous governments though idea starting kind dialogue never disappeared completely appeared salvadorean government played role gang truce reached march however became clear extremely sensitive issue el salvador pressure use hard handed approaches gangs particularly strong high levels insecurity reality many salvadoreans especially living marginalised neighbourhoods thus crime homicide require language mediation considered hazard human life pointed two factors eventually led funes administration abandon efforts de securitise gangs instead start securitising first factor reality gang violence extortion growing control large parts poor neighbourhoods endeavour deal effective way problems least communicate control without extraordinary measures hardly feasible time government lacked means shore immediate efforts integrated preventive policies able address causes problem secondly securitisation gang issue result pressures different audiences political opposition leading media country continuously criticised performance salvadorean government pushed tougher responses gang problem anti gang measures funes government partly means respond criticisms attempt halt efforts delegitimise government stance security respond demands large sectors salvadorean population tougher approach gang issue many salvadoreans ready securitisation generally considered option available something gang threat widespread support repressive approaches insecurity went hand hand suspicion alternative approaches controversy truce showed argue active support minister justice public security gang truce seen new type extraordinary measure government earlier measures clearly limited space gang members especially leaders truce opposite gave space especially communicate homeboys broader society repressive measures difficult sell broader population accommodating ones certainly indeed one key reasons remain silent policy journalists found government facilitated truce key protagonists within government come explanation like president funes remained silent issue denied involvement others like minister munguia payes came changing contradictory explanations last minute effort made chris van der borgh wim savenije defend legitimise truce pointing need customised policies deal extremely high homicide rates many key audiences however remained sceptical discussion changes funes government anti gang policies shows securitisation gangs rather messy process involving range stakeholders process question primarily whether securitise securitise repressive approaches clearly preferred different audiences country discussion optimal type customised policies continued funes government involved efforts repress gang members enrol support involvement solution initially deal gang problem later mainly way counter homicide rates el salvador shows two options repression gangs degree cooperation necessarily exclude one another though obviously serious tensions two strategies repressive accommodating extraordinary measures may unavoidable salvadorean context especially short term important discussion remains link longer term integrated security policy argue although policy makers funes administration recognised need longer term vision practice focus administration short term securitisation measures regard challenge developing integrated security policy met funes government chances integrated policy materialise time soon quite slim given popularity communicative benefits
